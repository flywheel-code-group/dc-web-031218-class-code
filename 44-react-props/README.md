# Webpack, Props, and State

## Issues

Managing libraries - npm
Keep the dom in sync with your application state - React
organizing code - ????

## Npm
- init, install, install --save, package.json, package-lock.json

## Babel
- transform our code
- jsx to React.createElement

Currently, a pain (have to re-run all the time)

## Webpack

gives us import and export
looks up in node_modules (react)
lets us separate our files
does the babel transform for us

gives us this awesome dev tool

## Props

## State
