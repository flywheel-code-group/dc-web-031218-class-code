# Welcome Back to Pokemon


We will be building the [pokemon search engine](https://pokemon-search.netlify.com/) in react!

This project has a db.json file that we can use as a fake server.

To run this program, open a new terminal window and call `json-server --watch db.json` -- this will start our server

Then run your react server in another window `npm i && npm start` -- this will be our frontend.

You should be able to make GET and POST request to `http://localhost:3000/pokemon`

Remember to add your headers to your POST request and to stringify the body.

Good luck!
